In Unix-type operating systems, the / dev / null, or null device, is a special file that discards all information written in it and that does not return any information to a process that reads it (more precisely, it returns an end of archive). In Unix programming jargon, it's also called a bit bucket or "black hole" . [See](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispositivo_nulo)
